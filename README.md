# TM4MicrocontrollerProjects
This repository is a grab bag of some of the projects I have worked on that use the TI-TM4 Microcontroller.
Much of the code will have been modified from code provided by Jason Losh, as stated in the code. I have asked for express consent to publish and make this content public. Feel free to use the code and test it on your own machines however, some projects will require proprietary hardware and thus will not be easily demonstrable.
Any includes required by the program may not be in the individual folders but will certainly be available within other folders.
